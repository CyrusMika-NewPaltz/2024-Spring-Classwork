Hello Professor Plotkin and the Web Server Programming class! My name is Cyrus Mika,
and I am a sophomore here at SUNY New Paltz with a major in Computer Science and a minor in
Geology. At New Paltz I’ve taken Computer Science I, II & III, as well as Discrete Mathematics
for Computing and Assembly Language & Computer Architecture (which I will be retaking at
some point). In addition to this computer science class, I am also taking Software Engineering and
Digital Logic this semester. Prior to New Paltz I was a part of the Software Engineering Major at
my high school, where I took classes in AP Computer Science A, Digital Logic, IT Fundamentals,
Web Development, Big Data and Cybersecurity. The main projects I’ve collaborated on in the past
were mainly primitive websites such as a housing search website my group accomplished using
an API, a website of fictional characters and fun facts about them, and a text-based adventure game
my group and I created using Java to simulate the high school experience.

I see myself using what I learn in this course in my personal project and improving my
preexisting skills. I’ve worked with HTML, CSS and JavaScript before, but I haven’t maintained
them so I’m quite rusty. I’m hoping through this class I can regain the skills I’ve lost as well as
learn new things about the process of web development. I’m particularly interested in how servers
are used and how to pull information from other websites using APIs. I have an idea for a personal
project where it’s a website that shows people animal hospitals in their area where they can filter
by animal type, wild/domestic, etc.

Based on your first class I am very excited to be here Professor Plotkin. You are very
committed to your students health and well being as well as academic performance, and I hope I
can make you proud this semester.
